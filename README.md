# 👋 Hi, I'm Trần Phong!

I’m a developer passionate about creating **innovative backend systems** using modern technologies. I don’t just build traditional CRUD apps; I enjoy using new tech to create **unique and exciting projects**.

## 🛠️ Technologies I Use

- **Backend Development**:  
  - Node.js ⚡  
  - NestJS 🚀  
  - PostgreSQL 🗄️  
  - MongoDB 🍃  
  - Redis 🔥

- **DevOps & Cloud**:  
  - Docker 🐳  
  - Ubuntu 🖥️  

- **Testing & Documentation**:  
  - Jest 🧪  
  - Swagger 📑  

## 🚀 My Approach to Coding

I focus on being **creative** with my coding. Instead of just building basic backend systems, I try to make each project **new** and **exciting** by using the latest technologies. My goal is to build **innovative** and **scalable** systems.

## 🧠 Fast Learner & Problem Solver

I’m good at **picking up new technologies quickly** and solving tough problems. I’m always excited to learn new things and find creative solutions to challenges.
